#### This quick start guide will take you through creating Rest Apis using Go.

Requirements: We assume you are familiar with Go and the software already installed on your system. If you did not install it OR need a quick reference I prepared a cheat-sheet. Please find toturial from https://github.com/hakimehmordadi/Go-Cheat-Sheet/blob/main/BashScrip.sh.

# Lets get dig into the codes ðŸš€

The first step to building the app is creating the structure now itâ€™s time to get down to it. Organize your file and folders like below picture.

Understanding how to work with files and folders is important. See details below 


* <code>assets/, </code> Contains image and other asset files to be copied as-is when you build your application. favicon.
* <code>go.mod</code> Module is go support for dependency management. A module by definition is a collection of related packages with go.mod at its root. The go.mod file defines the:
    * Module import path.
    * The version of go with which the module is created
    * Dependency requirements of the module for a successful build. It defines both projectâ€™s dependencies requirement and also locks them to their correct version.
<blockquote>
<code>  Module vs Package? </code> <p> A package is a directory of .go files, and it is the basic building block of a Go program. Packages help to organize code into reusable components. On the other side, a module is a collection of packages with built-in dependencies and versioning. A module comes with two additional files go.</p>

<blockquote>
<code>  go.mod vs go.sum? </code> <p> In the go.mod file there is a complete list of project dependencies and also in the go.sum file it stores a hash of each package to remember the version of the installed package.</p>

*   <code>README.md</code> Contains all required description that you provide for users.
*   <code>app.go</code> The main file that includes all code for this sample project.
